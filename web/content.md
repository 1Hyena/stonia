Welcome to [Erich Erstu's](https://ericherstu.net/ "Erich's personal web page")
fan page of Stonia!

Stonia is the first Estonian multi user dungeon ([MUD][ref-00]).

On this page you will find [area maps](#Maps), [fast travel paths](#Paths) and
other informative materials that may come handy to a dedicated Stonist.

If you are completely new to Stonia, then it is recommended to start from the
[Intro section](#Intro).


# Intro ########################################################################

Stonia is a text based role-playing game where multiple users can have a shared
adventure together. The players are supposed to either cooperate or kill each
other as these actions are an integral part of the game.

If you are interested in seeing how the game looks like, then play the following
screen recording. The video shows a short game session of a ghost mage who tests
out some of his magic spells on low level non-player characters (NPCs). This
screen recording also features some basic sound effects that have been added to
the game with the help of a custom MUD client.

              "Screen recording showing off Stonia MUD"

If you are on Linux and you would now like to try out Stonia yourself, then open
the command line terminal and simply type `telnet stonia.ttu.ee 4000`. That
should connect you to the Stonia MUD server.

If you are on Windows, then you should probably enable the Telnet client first.
For that, open the _Control Panel_, go to _Programs_ and select _Enable or
disable Windows features_. In the list of features, search for and select
_Telnet Client_. Confirm the operation by clicking _OK_ and follow the on-screen
instructions to complete the installation. After that open command console and
type `telnet stonia.ttu.ee 4000`.

Alternatively, you may download a special purpose MUD client such as the
[Jaba MUD Client][ref-01]. It allows you to specify hotkeys for certain commands
and much more. Playing with such a client is recommended because it makes the
game easier.

After playing some time you may experience something spectacular. Perhaps you
would like to share your story with others? One way to do this is to copy-paste
your MUD log onto a plaintext file and upload it to the
[Logstation of Stonia][ref-02]. Since others do the same, players get to see
and comment each other's adventures.
